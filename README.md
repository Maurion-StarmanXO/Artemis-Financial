# Artemis-Financial
Reflection on the Project
During the assessment, I successfully identified multiple software vulnerabilities that could have exposed Artemis Financial to security risks. One thing I did well was maintaining a methodical approach to vulnerability discovery, carefully following best practices in secure coding and penetration testing methodologies. Secure coding is critical because it directly supports a companyâ€™s reputation, customer trust, and long-term operational stability.

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was thoroughly testing for hidden or less obvious vulnerabilities, especially those related to insecure configurations or poor authentication mechanisms. It required careful attention to detail and a good understanding of both the codebase and system architecture.

To increase security layers, I applied principles such as input validation, proper authentication controls, and secure data storage techniques. In the future, I would continue using vulnerability scanning tools combined with manual code review to assess vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation strategies based on severity and exploitability.

After refactoring the code, I verified functionality and security by conducting additional vulnerability scans, performing regression testing, and manually reviewing the updated sections of code. This helped ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during the fixes.

Throughout the project, I relied on industry-standard tools and practices, including OWASP guidelines, static code analysis tools, and secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) frameworks. These resources are also applicable to future projects where security and code quality are critical.

This assignment is an excellent addition to my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to perform real-world security assessments, refactor code securely, and document findings professionally. Future employers can see that I have hands-on experience securing software applications and following structured, industry-accepted processes to mitigate risks.
